## **Homework 13**
1. **Recall that with the CSMA/CD protocol, the adapter waits K · 512 bit times after a collision, where K is drawn randomly. For K = 100, how long does the adapter wait until returning to Step 2 for a 100 Mbps broadcast channel? For a 1 Gbps broadcast channel?**

A: For a 100 Mbps: 512×100bits / 100×1000000bps = 512μsec
&emsp; For a 1 Gbps: 51.2μsec

1. **Suppose nodes A and B are on the same 10 Mbps broadcast channel, and the propagation delay between the two nodes is 245 bit times. Suppose A and B send Ethernet frames at the same time, the frames collide, and then A and B choose different values of K in the CSMA/CD algorithm. Assuming no other nodes are active, can the retransmissions from A and B collide? For our purposes, it suffices to work out the following example. Suppose A and B begin transmission at t = 0 bit times. They both detect collisions at t = 245 t bit times. Suppose KA = 0 and KB = 1. At what time does B schedule its retransmission? At what time does A begin transmission? (Note: The nodes must wait for an idle channel after returning to Step 2—see protocol.) At what time does A’s signal reach B? Does B refrain from transmitting at its scheduled time?**

A:

| Time | Event |
|---|---|
| 0 | A and B begin transmission |
| 245 | A and B detect collisions |
| 245+48 = 293 | A and B finish transmission |
| 293+245 = 538 | B arrives A |
| 538+96 = 634 | A starts transmission |
| 293+512 = 805 | B returns to Step 2 |
| 634+245 = 879 | A's signal reach B |

B's scheduled time = 805+96 > 879, so B refrain from transmitting.
