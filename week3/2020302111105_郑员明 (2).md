## Chapter2, P6

a. Either the server or the client will prompt the other party before closing the persistent connection, because the server or client will include the connection flag about "close" in the connection-header in the request message or response message before closing the connection.

b. HTTP does not provide encryption services.

c. HTTP clients generally have a limit on the number of concurrent connections to the same server. Three concurrent connections are allowed, but on some browsers, the maximum number of concurrent connections is 4 or 6.

d. No. When one end wants to disconnect, it will send a packet with the FIN flag set to 1, and data can still be received at this time. The connection can only be disconnected after multiple acknowledgments from both ends.

Server:

```python
import socket
import threading
import time

def tcplink(sock,addr):
    print('Accept new connection from %s:%s...'%addr)
    sock.send(b'Welcome!')
    while True:
        data = sock.recv(1024)
        time.sleep(1)
        if not data or data.decode('utf-8') == 'exit':
            break
        sock.send(('Hello,%s!'%data.decode('utf-8')).encode('utf-8'))
    sock.close()
    print('Connection from %s:%s closed' %addr)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.bind(('127.0.0.1',9999))
    s.listen(5)
    print('Waiting for connection...')
    while True:
        sock,addr = s.accept()
        t = threading.Thread(target=tcplink,args=(sock,addr))
        t.start()
```

Client:

```python
import socket

if __name__ == "__main__":
    s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM)
    s.connect(('127.0.0.1',9999))
    print(s.recv(1024).decode('utf-8'))
    for data in [b'A',b'B',b'C']:
        s.send(data)
        print(s.recv(1024).decode('utf-8'))
    s.send(b'exit')
    s.close
```
